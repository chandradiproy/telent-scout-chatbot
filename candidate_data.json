        "tech_questions_asked": "1. What are some key differences between Python's dynamic typing and static typing, and how would you approach type hinting in a large-scale Python project?\n2. How would you design a scalable data pipeline in Python to handle high-volume data processing, and what tools would you use to implement it?\n3. Can you describe a scenario where you would use Python's multiprocessing module to improve the performance of a CPU-bound task, and how would you optimize the process for maximum efficiency?\n4. How do you approach optimizing the memory usage of a Python application, particularly when dealing with large datasets, and what strategies would you use to prevent memory-related issues?",
        "tech_question_answers": "Python\u2019s dynamic typing allows variables to change types at runtime, making development faster and more flexible, while static typing enforces type definitions at compile time, which can prevent errors early but is less flexible. In large-scale Python projects, I use type hinting with the typing module to make the codebase easier to understand, catch potential issues with tools like mypy, and improve IDE support for maintainability.\n\nWhen designing a scalable data pipeline in Python, I would structure it into stages such as ingestion, transformation, and storage. For high-volume data, I\u2019d rely on tools like Apache Kafka for streaming, Apache Spark or Dask for distributed processing, and databases like PostgreSQL or NoSQL stores for persistence. I\u2019d also containerize the pipeline using Docker and orchestrate it with tools like Airflow to ensure scalability, reliability, and monitoring.\n\nA good scenario for Python\u2019s multiprocessing module is when dealing with CPU-bound tasks like image processing, numerical computations, or model training where the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) becomes a bottleneck. By distributing work across multiple processes, each running in its own memory space, performance improves significantly. To optimize efficiency, I\u2019d use process pools, avoid excessive inter-process communication, and carefully balance workload distribution.\n",
