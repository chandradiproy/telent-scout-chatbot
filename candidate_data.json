What is the main difference between MongoDB's document-based data model and a relational database management system like MySQL? How would you decide which one to use for a particular project?\n\n2. In a MERN application, how would you handle the conversion of JavaScript objects to JSON and vice versa, and why is this important for data transmission between the client and server?\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `async/await` syntax in Node.js, and how does it improve the readability and maintainability of asynchronous code? Can you provide an example of its usage?\n\n4. How would you implement authentication and authorization in a MERN application, and what are some common security considerations you would take into account when implementing these features?\n\nThese questions are designed to assess the candidate's understanding of the MERN tech stack and their ability to apply it to real-world scenarios.",
        "tech_question_answers": "1. MongoDB vs MySQL \u2013 Main Difference & Usage Decision\n\nDifference:\n\nMongoDB is document-based (NoSQL), storing data in flexible JSON-like documents.\n\nMySQL is relational (SQL), using structured tables with fixed schemas.\n\nWhen to use:\n\nMongoDB \u2192 best for projects with unstructured/rapidly changing data, scalability, or hierarchical relationships (e.g., chat apps, social media).\n\nMySQL \u2192 best when data integrity, transactions, and complex joins are critical (e.g., banking, e-commerce orders).\n\n2. Conversion of JS Objects \u2194 JSON in MERN Apps\n\nIn MERN, data must move between client (React) and server (Node/Express).\n\nConversion:\n\nJSON.stringify(object) \u2192 convert JS object to JSON before sending to backend.\n\nJSON.parse(jsonString) \u2192 convert JSON back to JS object for frontend use.\n\nImportance: Ensures consistent data transmission between client and server in a standardized format (JSON), making APIs language-agnostic and preventing type mismatches.\n\n3. Purpose of async/await in Node.js\n\nPurpose: Makes asynchronous code look and behave like synchronous code. It avoids \"callback hell\" and improves readability and maintainability.\n\nExample:\n\nasync function getUserData(id) {\n  try {\n    const user = await User.findById(id);   // waits for DB result\n    return user;\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error(err);\n  }\n}\n\n\nBenefit: Cleaner flow, easier error handling with try/catch, and better debugging compared to raw callbacks or .then() chains.\n\n4. Authentication & Authorization in MERN\n\nAuthentication:\n\nVerify user identity (e.g., login with email/password).\n\nTypically use JWT (JSON Web Token) or sessions. On login, generate a token and send it to the client, which attaches it in headers for every request.\n\nAuthorization:\n\nDefine user roles (e.g., admin, regular user).\n\nMiddleware checks the JWT and ensures the user has permission before granting access to routes.\n\nSecurity considerations:\n\nHash passwords with bcrypt before storing.\n\nUse HTTPS for secure data transfer.\n\nSet token expiry and refresh tokens.\n\nPrevent XSS and CSRF attacks with proper headers.",

What is the difference between the `innerHTML` and `outerHTML` properties in JavaScript, and when would you use each? Can you provide an example of when `outerHTML` would be more suitable than `innerHTML`?\n\n2. How would you optimize the performance of a web page that heavily relies on CSS animations, and what are some common pitfalls to avoid when using animations in CSS?\n\n3.

How would you debug an issue where a closure is not behaving as expected?\n\n4. What is the difference between using `display: block` and `display: inline-block` for a CSS element, and when would you choose one over the other? Can you provide an example of a use case where `display: inline-block` would be more suitable than `display: block`?\n\nThese questions aim to assess the candidate's understanding of fundamental concepts and their ability to apply them in practical scenarios.",
        "tech_question_answers": "When working with the DOM in JavaScript, innerHTML represents only the content inside an element, while outerHTML includes the element itself plus its content. For example, if you want to replace just the text or markup inside a <div>, you\u2019d use innerHTML. But if you need to completely replace the element \u2014 say swapping out a <p> with an <h2> \u2014 then outerHTML makes more sense. A practical case is dynamically changing a card component into another type of element without leaving the wrapper behind.\n\nFor CSS animations, performance often comes down to which properties you animate. Animating layout-related properties like width or top triggers reflows and is expensive. Instead, sticking to properties like transform and opacity keeps animations smooth because they can run on the GPU. Another optimization is reducing unnecessary repaints, avoiding large box shadows or gradients in motion, and using will-change sparingly for elements you know will animate. The pitfall to avoid is overusing animations everywhere\u2014too many moving elements can actually degrade both performance and usability.\n\nClosures in JavaScript are essentially functions that \u201cremember\u201d the scope in which they were created, even after that scope has finished executing. They\u2019re great for creating reusable logic. For example, a function that generates counters can return another function that increments a private variable each time it\u2019s called. That private variable lives inside the closure. If a closure doesn\u2019t behave as expected, the bug is often due to scoping issues \u2014 for instance, variables being shared across loops unintentionally. Debugging usually means inspecting which scope the closure is capturing and using console logs or the debugger to step through.\n\nFinally, when it comes to display: block versus display: inline-block, a block element always starts on a new line and takes the full width, whereas inline-block sits inline with other elements but still allows you to apply width, height, and margin. Inline-block is especially useful when you want horizontally aligned items, like navigation links, where each needs its own box model behavior without breaking onto a new line. If you used block instead, each link would stack vertically, which isn\u2019t ideal for a nav bar.",

What is the purpose of the `with` statement in Python, and how does it help with resource management? Can you provide an example of its usage?\n\n2.

When would you use each, and why? Provide an example of when you would use each.\n\n4. Can you explain the concept of generators in Python? How would you use a generator to iterate over a large dataset without loading the entire dataset into memory?\n\nThese questions are designed to assess the candidate's understanding of fundamental Python concepts, their problem-solving skills, and their ability to apply Python syntax and semantics to real-world scenarios.",
        "tech_question_answers": "1. Purpose of with in Python\n\nThe with statement is used for context management, ensuring resources are acquired and released properly. It\u2019s most common with file handling, where it automatically closes the file even if an error occurs.\nExample:\n\n# without 'with' \u2192 need to remember file.close()\nwith open(\"data.txt\", \"r\") as f:\n    content = f.read()\n# file is automatically closed here\n\n\nThis helps prevent resource leaks and makes code cleaner.\n\n2. Decorator for Logging Execution Time\n\nA decorator wraps a function to add extra behavior. For execution time logging:\n\nimport time\nfrom functools import wraps\n\ndef log_time(func):\n    @wraps(func)\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        start = time.time()\n        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n        end = time.time()\n        print(f\"{func.__name__} executed in {end - start:.4f} seconds\")\n        return result\n    return wrapper\n\n@log_time\ndef slow_function():\n    time.sleep(2)\n\nslow_function()   # \u2192 prints execution time\n\n\nThis is useful for performance monitoring and debugging.\n\n3. Difference Between List and Tuple\n\nList \u2192 Mutable, allows modifications (add, remove, update).\n\nTuple \u2192 Immutable, cannot be modified after creation.\n\nWhen to use:\n\nUse list when you need dynamic data structures, e.g., storing items in a shopping cart.\n\nUse tuple when data shouldn\u2019t change, e.g., storing fixed coordinates (lat, long).\n\nExample:\n\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3]   # can append or modify\nmy_tuple = (10.0, 20.0)  # represents fixed GPS coordinates\n\n4. Concept of Generators\n\nGenerators are functions that use yield to produce values lazily, one at a time, instead of loading everything into memory. They\u2019re great for large datasets.\n\nExample \u2013 Iterating over large file:\n\ndef read_large_file(file_path):\n    with open(file_path, \"r\") as f:\n        for line in f:\n            yield line.strip()  # yields one line at a time\n\nfor row in read_large_file(\"bigdata.txt\"):\n    print(row)  # processes without loading entire file\n\n\nThis avoids memory overload and improves efficiency when handling huge data streams.",

Optimizing page load time with many elements\n\nTechniques include lazy loading images, minifying CSS/JS, using a content delivery network (CDN), and reducing unnecessary DOM elements.\n\nIn practice, I\u2019ve optimized load time by implementing image compression and deferring non-critical scripts.\n\n3. Semantic HTML and its importance\n\nSemantic HTML uses meaningful tags (like <header>, <article>, <footer>) to describe structure.\n\nIt improves accessibility for screen readers, SEO ranking, and maintainability.\n\nFor example, replacing generic <div> tags with semantic tags in a blog layout makes the page easier for both developers and assistive technologies to understand.\n\n4. Handling dynamic third-party content\n\nWhen content comes from a third-party service, I typically embed it using <iframe>, scripts, or APIs.\n\nA solution I\u2019ve used is wrapping the external content in a container with custom styling, ensuring it blends with the site while keeping it isolated for security.",

How do you optimize the load time of a web page, and what tools would you use to measure performance?\n3. What is your approach to structuring a complex HTML document, and how do you ensure accessibility and maintainability?\n4. How do you handle browser compatibility issues when using HTML5 features, and what are some common workarounds you've used in the past?",
        "tech_question_answers": "Difference between id and class in HTML\nid is unique to a single element, while class can be shared across multiple elements.\n\nUse id when you need to uniquely identify or manipulate one element (e.g., a form\u2019s submit button).\n\nUse class for styling or applying behavior to multiple elements.\n\nOptimizing page load time with many elements\nTechniques include lazy loading images, minifying CSS/JS, using a content delivery network (CDN), and reducing unnecessary DOM elements.\n\nIn practice, I\u2019ve optimized load time by implementing image compression and deferring non-critical scripts.\n\nSemantic HTML and its importance\nSemantic HTML uses meaningful tags (like <header>, <article>, <footer>) to describe structure.\n\nIt improves accessibility for screen readers, SEO ranking, and maintainability.\n\nFor example, replacing generic <div> tags with semantic tags in a blog layout makes the page easier for both developers and assistive technologies to understand.\n\nHandling dynamic third-party content\nWhen content comes from a third-party service, I typically embed it using <iframe>, scripts, or APIs.\n\nA solution I\u2019ve used is wrapping the external content in a container with custom styling, ensuring it blends with the site while keeping it isolated for security.",
